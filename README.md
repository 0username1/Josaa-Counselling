# Josaa-Counselling
The Joint Seat Allocation Authority (JoSAA) 2022 has been set up to manage and regulate the joint seat allocation for admissions to 6 institutes for the academic year 2022-23. This includes 2 IITs, 2 NITs, 2 IIITs. Admission to all the academic programs offered by these Institutes will be made through a single platform.

5. We will display opening and closing ranks for the two Rounds based on the candidates choice.


1. We stored the details of the student.
2. Based on the candidates qualification we print the list of Eligible Institutes.
3. Then we store the candidates top 3 choices.
4. Now we check whether the candidates rank lies between the opening and closing rank of his preferred choice of Institute and branch for the respective round.
5. Based on Step 3 and 4 Round 1 seat is allotted to the student.
6. Candidate has to choose whether he wants to Float/Freeze his seat.
7. If Freeze is chosen as the option then the seat is  allotted and the candidate will not be allowed to participate in the next round.
8. If Float is chosen then based on Step 3 and 4 Round 2 seat is allotted to the student.
9 This is the final allotted seat.
